Q: How will 5ire help in supporting UN SDGs?
‚Ä£ 5ire aims to become a blockchain ecosystem for the 5th industrial revolution, where self-sovereign decentralized organizations are empowered & incentivized toward accelerating the implementation of the United Nations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.
‚Ä£ 5ireChain's primary proposition is its unique consensus mechanism - "Proof of 5ire‚Äù, which includes proof of benefit, nominated proof of stake and proof of donation. It integrates sustainability at the core of blockchain and empowers nodes for sustainable practices, by incentivising them economically.
‚Ä£ In the real world, if there are two individuals, Josh & Bob. Now if Josh has more sustainable practices than Bob, then he would end up making more rewards!
